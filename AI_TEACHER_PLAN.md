# AI Teacher Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to transform the simple AI chat interface into a sophisticated AI teaching system with personalized learning capabilities, memory, and advanced dialogue management. The goal is to create an experience that simulates the adaptability and personalization of a real teacher.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Memory & Personalization System

#### Short-term Memory
- **Purpose**: Maintain contextual awareness within sessions
- **Implementation**: 
  - Enhance current chat message history to track concepts discussed
  - Store user's understanding signals from the current session
  - Maintain dialogue state across multiple interactions

#### Long-term Memory
- **Purpose**: Remember user's learning patterns and concept mastery across sessions
- **Implementation**: 
  - Create database tables to store user learning profiles
  - Implement vector embeddings for semantic retrieval of past interactions
  - Build a knowledge graph to map relationships between concepts and user understanding

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users and their learning profiles
CREATE TABLE user_learning_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  learning_style JSONB,
  technical_level INTEGER,
  interests TEXT[],
  background TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Concept mastery tracking
CREATE TABLE concept_mastery (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  concept_id TEXT,
  confidence_level FLOAT,
  exposure_count INTEGER,
  last_reviewed TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  needs_reinforcement BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Learning interactions
CREATE TABLE learning_interactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  session_id UUID,
  question TEXT,
  answer TEXT,
  concepts TEXT[],
  effectiveness_rating FLOAT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable vector search for semantic retrieval
ALTER TABLE learning_interactions ADD COLUMN question_embedding vector(1536);
CREATE INDEX on learning_interactions USING ivfflat (question_embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

### 2. Personalized Learning Engine

#### User Modeling
- **Purpose**: Adapt teaching approach based on individual needs
- **Implementation**:
  - Create user profiles that track learning styles and preferences
  - Develop algorithms to identify concept mastery levels
  - Implement adaptive response generation based on user proficiency

#### Learning Progress Analysis
- **Purpose**: Track and respond to user's learning journey
- **Implementation**:
  - Build analytics for detecting knowledge gaps
  - Create visualization components for learning progress
  - Develop recommendation engine for suggested topics

### 3. Advanced Dialogue Management

#### Multi-turn Reasoning
- **Purpose**: Create coherent teaching sequences
- **Implementation**:
  - Design dialogue state manager
  - Implement Socratic questioning techniques
  - Create scaffolded learning sequences

#### Teaching Strategies
- **Purpose**: Vary explanation approaches based on user needs
- **Implementation**:
  - Create strategy selection algorithm
  - Implement multiple explanation techniques
  - Develop feedback interpretation mechanisms

## Technical Implementation

### Core Types

```typescript
// User memory structure
interface UserMemory {
  conceptMastery: Record<string, {
    confidence: number,
    lastReviewed: Date,
    reviewCount: number,
    misconceptions: string[]
  }>;
  learningStyle: {
    preferredExamples: string[],
    comprehensionSpeed: number,
    visualLearner: boolean
  };
  interactionHistory: {
    commonQuestions: string[],
    responseEffectiveness: Record<string, number>
  };
}

// Enhanced message for teaching context
interface TeachingMessage extends Message {
  concepts?: string[];
  isUnderstanding?: boolean;
  needsReinforcementOn?: string[];
  followUpQuestions?: string[];
}

// Teaching agent
class AITeacher {
  private userMemory: UserMemoryManager;
  private dialogManager: DialogueManager;
  private conceptGraph: KnowledgeGraph;
  private teachingStrategies: TeachingStrategySelector;
  
  async respondToStudent(question: string, context: LearningContext): Promise<Response> {
    // Update memory with new interaction
    this.userMemory.recordInteraction(question);
    
    // Analyze question for misconceptions
    const misconceptions = await this.detectMisconceptions(question);
    
    // Determine teaching approach
    const approach = this.teachingStrategies.selectForConcept(
      context.currentConcept,
      this.userMemory.getLearningStyle(),
      misconceptions
    );
    
    // Generate personalized response
    const response = await this.generateTeacherResponse(question, approach);
    
    // Track concept exposure and update model
    this.userMemory.updateConceptExposure(context.currentConcept);
    
    return {
      content: response,
      suggestedFollowups: this.generateFollowups(),
      conceptsReinforced: this.identifyReinforcedConcepts(response)
    };
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Prompt Engineering

```typescript
function buildTeacherPrompt(
  userProfile: UserProfile, 
  currentTopic: string,
  dialogHistory: Message[],
  userKnowledgeState: KnowledgeState
): Message[] {
  // Retrieve personalized context
  const relevantHistory = getRelevantInteractions(userProfile.id, currentTopic);
  const learningStyle = userProfile.learningPreferences;
  const knownConcepts = userKnowledgeState.masteredConcepts;
  const strugglingConcepts = userKnowledgeState.weakConcepts;
  
  // Build system message with personalization
  const systemMessage = {
    role: "system",
    content: `You are teaching ${userProfile.name} about ${currentTopic}.
      They learn best through ${learningStyle.preferredFormat}.
      They already understand ${knownConcepts.join(', ')}.
      They need extra help with ${strugglingConcepts.join(', ')}.
      In past sessions, these examples resonated well: ${relevantHistory.effectiveExamples.join('; ')}.
      Use a ${userProfile.technicalLevel} technical level.
      ${getTeachingStrategy(userProfile, currentTopic)}`
  };
  
  return [systemMessage, ...formatDialogHistory(dialogHistory)];
}
```
