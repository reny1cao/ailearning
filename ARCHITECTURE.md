## Architectural Principles

### Component Organization

1. **Component Atomicity**: Components should be designed with the principle of single responsibility.
2. **Component Composition**: Build complex UIs by composing smaller, reusable components.
3. **Component Categorization**:
   - **UI Components**: Basic, stateless UI elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
   - **Feature Components**: Components specific to a feature
   - **Layout Components**: Components that define page structure
   - **Page Components**: Components that represent entire pages/routes
   - **Section Components**: Larger sections of pages that can be extracted

### State Management

1. Use React hooks for component-level state
2. Use context for sharing state between closely related components
3. Use global state management (Redux, Zustand, etc.) for application-wide state

### Code Organization Best Practices

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate UI, logic, and data access
2. **Modularity**: Keep modules small and focused
3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Components: PascalCase
   - Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix
   - Utils/Functions: camelCase
   - Files: Match the component name they export
4. **Import Organization**:
   - React imports first
   - Library imports second
   - Absolute imports of your own code third
   - Relative imports last

## Component Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Refactor Page Components

Extract sections from pages when:
1. The page component exceeds 200 lines
2. A section is reused across multiple pages
3. A section has complex logic that can be isolated

### Section Component Guidelines

1. Place section components in a dedicated `/sections` directory organized by page
2. Name section components with the pattern `[Page][SectionName]`
3. Pass only necessary props to section components

## API and Services

1. Use a service-based approach for data fetching
2. Centralize API calls in dedicated service files
3. Use custom hooks to connect components to services

## Performance Considerations

1. Use React.memo for pure components that render often
2. Use virtualization for long lists
3. Implement code splitting for larger page components
4. Optimize images and assets

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for utility functions
2. Component tests for UI components
3. Integration tests for feature components
4. End-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Deployment and CI/CD

1. Use environment variables for configuration
2. Implement continuous integration for automated testing
3. Use staging environments for pre-production testing

## Documentation Standards

1. Include JSDoc comments for functions and components
2. Document props using TypeScript interfaces
3. Maintain up-to-date README files for major directories

By following this architecture, the project will be more maintainable, scalable, and easier to collaborate on.
